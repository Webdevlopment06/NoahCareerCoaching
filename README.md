Website Notes(imma put them here so you see it)

PROBLEMS:
Text on the Logo looks really small, especially in the favicon.

The hero in index.html has a small blue bar on the left, as if someone didnt crop it all the way

files are generally pretty big (300ish lines) I'm working to remedy this.

VScode is telling me that the style.css has 7 errors because there are placeholders in it


CHANGES FROM MAIN:
the nav is in its own file and uses absolute links so that I could put things in separate folders without breaking everything
