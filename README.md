## Romes Notes:
- A lot of the fonts are wrong for some reason, I think there are some imports somewhere that are messing with them.
- the state content is in a component, so it keeps the size of the page down.
- there are starting to be a lot of images. we should think about a way to organize them.
- I'm thinking about making the navbar change color depending on what page you are on
- I added some new icons to explore, they are all from flaticon.com
