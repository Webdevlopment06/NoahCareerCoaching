Website Notes(imma put them here so you see it)

PROBLEMS:
Text on the Logo looks really small, especially in the favicon.

The hero in index.html has a small blue bar on the left, as if someone didn't crop it all the way

VScode is telling me that the style.css has 7 errors because there are placeholders in it (can i delete it?)

I'm thinking about putting all of the main content into a region or like a main tag so I can collapse it

indentation is not the same between files (this is my fault)

the back to top button can be clicked when it is invisible at the top (minor issue)

NOTEABLE CHANGES FROM MAIN:
There is a javascript file that inserts all the stuff every file will need, so the head stuff, the nav, the backtotop button, and the bootstrap link on the bottom. now the head just needs the title and the import of that script.

because of the change in file structure, I use absolute links to avoid issues with navigation.
