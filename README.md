# Setup Instructions

## Installation

```bash
npm i
```

## Running the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

> **Note:** Make sure you are in the project folder before running these commands.

## Romes Notes:
- A lot of the fonts are wrong for some reason, I think there are some imports somewhere that are messing with them.
- the state content is in a component, so it keeps the size of the page down.
