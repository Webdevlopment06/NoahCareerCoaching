Website Notes(imma put them here so you see it)

Problems:
Text on the Logo looks really small, especially in the favicon.

The hero in index.html has a small blue bar on the left, as if someone didnt crop it all the way

CHANGES FROM MAIN

the nav is in its own file and uses absolute links so that I could put things in separate folders without breaking everything
