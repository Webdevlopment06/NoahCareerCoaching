## Romes Notes:

### ISSUES:
- A lot of the fonts are wrong for some reason, I think there are some imports somewhere that are messing with them. However, This not really an issue and more of just a change. The site still looks and works fine with this.

### CHANGES:
- The state content is in a component, so it keeps the size of the page down.
- I added some new icons to explore, they are all from flaticon.com
- The Navbar is position absolute and there is some javascript to make each page 
- The Navbar page you are on is indicated in blue.

### IDEAS:
- there are starting to be a lot of images. we should think about a way to organize them.
