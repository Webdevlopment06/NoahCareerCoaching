## Romes Notes:
- I think most of the pages are good I just need to check, It's just that all of the fonts are wrong for some reason
- also a lot of it is hardcoded styles not bootstrap and i had to mess with the style.css a lot
- some of the career pages are not showing thier images even in the normal main, so imma have to fix that
- state dropdown links are broken lol
