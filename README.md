## Romes Notes:
- I think most of the pages are good I just need to check, It's just that all of the fonts are wrong for some reason
- also a lot of it is hardcoded styles not bootstrap and i had to mess with the style.css a lot
- I couldn't check if the career pages are correct, as they are not working on the deployment. I'm pretty sure they are not working, as none of them have a hero image.
- EqualE and Youth are different despite the styles being the exact same so idk whats going on there
