Website Notes

Problems:
missing image files: "Large Section Image", "Headshot"
Logo looks really small 
The hero in index.html has a small blue bar on the left, as if someone didnt crop it all the way
these link names are off from the mural, I renamed some of the about stuff but it isnt very clear where 
I am supposed to go with this template.

Possible Optimizations:
The navbar has to be copied into each file, if we were using something like react, we could just use it as a 
component and put it once and have it be in every page
